# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


### Steps to run the project locally

- Install `pnpm` locally using [this](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Clone the project
- `cd` into the project folder
- create `.env` file and create a variable called `VITE_FOURSQUARE_API_KEY` and add the api key that you have set up in the foursquare dashboard.
- run `pnpm install`
- run `pnpm run dev`
